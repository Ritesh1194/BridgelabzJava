/*******************************************************************************
 * 1. Behavioral Design Patterns :- 2.Visitor pattern is used when we have to
 * perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of
 * visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to
 * another class. For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add
 * different type of items (Elements). When we click on checkout button, it
 * calculates the total amount to be paid. Now we can have the calculation logic
 * in item classes or we can move out this logic to another class using visitor
 * pattern. Letâ€™s implement this in our example of visitor pattern.
